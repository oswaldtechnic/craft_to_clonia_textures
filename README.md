## Disclaimer
All mobs, some UI, and other things will not transfer over.
Some things are not reasonably possible to transfer (like the brewing stand),
and many things are just not added in yet.

If a pack has custom models for blocks, that can cause problems with the transfer.

The config.json file _DOES NOTHING YET_.

## Usage
- Run the project once, and it'll create an input folder and an output folder.
- Place texture packs from Minecraft into the input folder.
- Run the project again, and it'll place the converted packs into the output folder.
